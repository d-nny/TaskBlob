# Default mail location

# If you need to set multiple mailbox locations or want to change default
# namespace settings, you can do it by adding sections like this:
#
#namespace inbox {
#  # Namespace type: private, shared or public
#  #type = private
#
#  # Hierarchy separator to use. You should use the same separator for all
#  # namespaces or some clients get confused. '/' is usually a good one.
#  # The default however depends on the underlying mail storage format.
#  #separator = 
#
#  # Prefix required to access this namespace. This needs to be different for
#  # all namespaces. For example "Public/".
#  #prefix = 
#
#  # Physical location of the mailbox. This is in same format as
#  # mail_location, which is also the default for it.
#  #location =
#
#  # There can be only one INBOX, and this setting defines which namespace
#  # has it.
#  inbox = yes
#
#  # If namespace is hidden, it's not advertised to clients via NAMESPACE
#  # extension. You'll most likely also want to set list=no. This is mostly
#  # useful when converting from another server with different namespaces which
#  # you want to deprecate but still keep working. For example you can create
#  # hidden namespaces with prefixes mailbox=, ~ and mail/.
#  #hidden = no
#
#  # Show the mailboxes under this namespace with LIST command. This makes the
#  # namespace visible for clients that don't support NAMESPACE extension.
#  # "children" value lists child mailboxes, but hides the namespace prefix.
#  #list = yes
#
#  # Namespace handles its own subscriptions. If set to "no", the parent
#  # namespace handles them (empty prefix should always have this as "yes")
#  #subscriptions = yes
#
#  # See 15-mailboxes.conf for definitions of special mailboxes.
